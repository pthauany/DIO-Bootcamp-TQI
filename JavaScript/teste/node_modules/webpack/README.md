<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**TL;DR**

* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

### Get Started

Check out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.

<h2 align="center">Concepts</h2>

### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)

webpack has a [rich plugin
interface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
**flexible**.
